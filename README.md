# Review-Problems

Just solving a list of interview questions for algorithms and data structures review.

## Arrays/Strings:
* ~~Determine if a string is a palindrome~~
* ~~Merge two sorted arrays~~
* ~~Reverse an array in place~~
* ~~Determine if string is a substring~~
* ~~Sorting algorithms: quicksort, mergesort, bucketsort, and countingsort~~
* ~~Binary search in a sorted rotated array~~
* ~~Matrix multiplication~~
* ~~Find all duplicates in an array~~

## Linked List:
* ~~Reverse a singly linked list~~
* ~~Delete/Insert a node in a linked list~~
* ~~Detect if there is a cycle in the list and return its starting point~~
* ~~Merge two sorted lists~~
* ~~Split a list into two lists where one has the even indices while other has the odd indices~~

## Trees:
* Construct a BST from a sorted array
* ~~All traversals~~
* BFS/DFS
* Check if a tree is balanced
* Check if two trees are mirror image of each other
* Find max path sum in the tree where negative nodes are possible
* Find the lowest common ancestor of 2 nodes in a tree

## Backtracking:
* ~~Find all permutations of an array~~
* ~~Find all possible subsets of an array~~
* ~~Convert numbers into words according to letters on an old phone keypad~~

## Hashtables
* ~~Keep track of multiple occurrences of an object~~

## Dynamic programming:
* ~~Given you can climb 1, 2, or 3 stairs in one step, how many ways can you reach the top?~~
* How many ways to go from top left of a grid to bottom right of the grid with some obstacles in between?
* Djikstra's shortest path algorithm
